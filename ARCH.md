SNET Architecture
==================

SNET contains client- and service-side functionality to run a communication
protocol stack over a simulated medium. Here is an overview of the file
structure of this repo.

| Directory | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| src/      | SNET gRPC-based service source code |
| cfg/      | Configuration files for running SNET service |
| protobuf/ | Google Protocol Buffer specification files; these files define the RPC API in SNET |


Service
-------
The SNET service is written in Java. The code can be found in the src/
directory. Here is a description of each of the Java packages used in the SNET
service code.
 
| Package | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| com.marshmallow.snet.app              | SNET applications built on top of the rest of the SNET code |
| com.marshmallow.snet.client           | SNET client code |
| com.marshmallow.snet.core             | Core SNET utilities (like logging) |
| com.marshmallow.snet.handler          | Code for handling specific SNET service access points |
| com.marshmallow.snet.service          | SNET service code |
| com.marshmallow.snet.service.protobuf | Generated Google Protocol Buffers/gRPC code | 
| com.marshmallow.snet.service.test     | SNET unit tests |

Client
------
There is currently not client-side SNET code (other than the stuff generated by
Google Protocol Buffers/gRPC). However, there is future support planned for the
following languages.
- C++
- Java
- Python

API
---
The SNET RPC API can be found in protobuf/snet.proto. Essentially, a node on the
network communicates in 2 ways with the service.
1. Tx - the node transmits some data to the service (i.e., the network medium).
2. Rx - the node listens for data from the service (i.e., the network medium).
